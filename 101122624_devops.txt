George Brown's DevOps course COMP 3104 is important as it instills in students the importance of CI/CD, or
continuous integration and continuous delivery. By the end of the course students will learn and experience tools and
practices to deliver applications at a faster rate. Some concepts learned so far include horizontal vs vertical scaling, single
page applications, and core principles related to DevOps. All of our learning will help us develop applications in a modern way
improving our overal skill sets. Because Devops is a culture that bridges operation and development meaning that we do not need
seperate teams for these purposes.
