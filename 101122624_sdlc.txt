DevOps is important to learn as when applied to the software development lifecycle it makes the steps easier to go through

the implementation phase. Jenkins with plugins can automate deployment and testing with a workflow that tests code changes in the
repository and if there are no errors it releases the code to an environment thats ready for release.
