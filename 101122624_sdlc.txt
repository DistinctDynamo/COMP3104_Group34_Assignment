DevOps is important to learn as when applied to the software development lifecycle it makes the steps easier to go through thanks to
automation, continuous integration tools like github/gitlab lets the team see what others are working on improving pace of 
the implementation phase. Jenkins with plugins can automate deployment and testing with a workflow that tests code changes in the
repository and if there are no errors it releases the code to an environment thats ready for release. Since DevOps tools include
error checking during the process of developing an application the maintenance phase is greatly shortened. The speed and constant
knowledge between the team is thanks to DevOps being a offshoot of agile development which emphasizes constant communication
and teamwork.
