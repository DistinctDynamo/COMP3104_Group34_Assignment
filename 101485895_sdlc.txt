DevOps is important in software development cycles
because it allows programmers to more efficiently
and effictively develop their programs.

DevOps encourages collaboration in a way where
programmers can split their workload with their
peerse and simultaneously work on the same projects
at the same time.
This allows for faster development cycles since multiple
people are working on the projects which also allows 
programmers to get peers to review the code more intimately
since they are also working on the sames files.
